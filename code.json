	"description": "The abundance of wildlife occurrence datasets that are currently accessible can be valuable for efforts such as species distribution modeling and range delineation.  However, the task of downloading and cleaning occurrence records is often complex due to errors and uncertainties that are present in datasets.  This repository provides a framework for collecting and filtering occurrence data that are freely available through API's and data requests.",
